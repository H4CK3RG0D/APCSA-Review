# Overview
The AP Computer Science A Exam is a comprehensive exam that tests your knowledge of programming concepts and skills. It consists of two sections: multiple-choice and free-response questions (FRQs). The multiple-choice section contains 40 questions that you must answer within 1 hour and 30 minutes. The FRQ section contains four questions that you must answer within 1 hour and 30 minutes.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide practice FRQs for students(including me) preparing for the AP Computer Science A Exam. The FRQs generated by ChatGPT are designed to help you practice applying programming concepts and skills in a variety of scenarios. By practicing with these FRQs, you can improve your ability to analyze problems, design solutions, and implement code.

# Contributing
If you want to contribute to this repository, please make a pull request with your FRQs. Your contributions will be greatly appreciated by myself and others preparing for the AP Computer Science A Exam. To ensure that your contributions are effective, please make sure that your FRQs are well-written, clear, and challenging.

# Additional Resources
If you want to learn more about programming concepts and skills, there are many resources available to you. Some of these resources include online tutorials, textbooks, and practice problems. Additionally, you can find sample FRQs and other resources on the [College Board Website](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/free-response-questions-by-year).
