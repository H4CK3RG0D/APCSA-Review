# APCSA Review
 
This is my codes for reviewing FRQs for the AP Computer SCience A Exam. The FRQs you see here are artifically generated by ChatGPT. Some of the FRQs will be also taken from past AP Exams. If you want to contribute, please make a pull request as it will help me and others reviewing for the exam. Also, if you want to get the FRQs from the past AP Exams, please go to the [College Board Website](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/free-response-questions-by-year) and download the FRQs from there.
